/*
Write a program that takes in an integer in the range 20-98 as input. 
The output is a countdown starting from the integer, and stopping when both output 
digits are identical.

Ex: If the input is:
93

the output is:
93 92 91 90 89 88

Ex: If the input is:
77

the output is:
77

Ex: If the input is:
15

or any value not between 20 and 98 (inclusive), the output is:
Input must be 20-98

For coding simplicity, follow each output number by a space, even the last one.

Use a while loop. Compare the digits; do not write a large if-else for all possible 
same-digit numbers (11, 22, 33, â€¦, 88), as that approach would be cumbersome for 
larger ranges.
